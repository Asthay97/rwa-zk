# Real World Asset Tokenisation

## Introduction

Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization involves the representation of tangible assets such as real estate properties, vehicles, and machineries as digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens represent ownership or partial ownership of the underlying assets, allowing investors to participate in asset ownership and trade fractions of high-value assets easily. This README provides an extensive overview of Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWA) with a focus on AssetGuard, a zk-ID verified RWA platform.

## AssetGuard: A zk-ID Verified RWA Platform

AssetGuard is a secure and zk-verified platform designed to facilitate the tokenization of tangible assets, enabling users to obtain loans, trade, and sell fractional ownership of these assets with ease. The platform offers the following key features:

- **Loan Facilities:** Users can list their tangible assets on AssetGuard to obtain loans against them. The platform streamlines the loan application process and ensures the security of transactions through zero-knowledge-based verifications.

- **Trading and Selling:** AssetGuard allows users to trade and sell fractional ownership of tangible assets such as real estate properties, gold, vehicles, and machinery. This opens up new avenues for investment and liquidity in traditionally illiquid assets.

- **Security and Credibility:** By leveraging zero-knowledge-based verifications, AssetGuard enhances security and credibility in asset transactions. Users can trust the platform for secure and transparent transactions.

- **Blockchain Tracking:** AssetGuard utilizes blockchain technology to track immutable ownership transfers from one owner to another. This ensures transparency and prevents fraudulent activities in asset transactions.

## Platform Modules

AssetGuard consists of several modules that work together to provide a seamless user experience:

1. **Admin:** The Admin module serves as the portal for adding, approving, granting loans, and investing in all listed tangible assets on the platform. It provides administrators with the necessary tools to manage the platform efficiently.

2. **KYC:** The KYC module is a Polygon-ID-based verification portal responsible for issuing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials, and generating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs. It ensures the authenticity and credibility of users and assets listed on the platform.

3. **RWA:** The RWA module acts as a centralized portal where users can view all listed tangible assets and manage their dashboards. It integrates seamlessly with the KYC and Admin modules to provide a comprehensive asset management solution.
